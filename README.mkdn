Require this package and call compile with the directory you want to compile.  Anything ending in ```*.html``` will be compiled to an unminified string with none of the handlebars options.

```coffeescript
compile = require('handlebars-precompiler').compile
compileTemplates = compile 'templates'
```

On the browser side, you will need to deploy the Handlebars runtime-only release.
You could use the full release which includes a compiler, but your site will be faster if you don't.
